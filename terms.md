Vehichaul LLC agrees to provide Customer with Vehichaul SaaS according to the following Specifications (the "Specifications"):
Vehichaul LLC provides Vehichaul SaaS in the form of cloud-based Software, Hosting Services, Mobile ePod Applications and Support Services.

### 1.1 Mobile Applications
Vehichaul has mobile ePod applications available for both iOS and Android. Seat license subscriptions are required for each individual Driver ("seat") allowed to use the iOS or Android Mobile ePod Application to access Vehichaul during the customer subscription term.

Mobile Client Subscriptions may be reduced during subscription renewal period.
Vehichaul Mobile ePod Application allows VINs to be assigned to Drivers, track VIN locations via GPS, upload damages with photos, and electronic proof of delivery. The VehicHaul mobile ePod Application utilizes individual Driver location data collected from the mobile devices (e.g. latitude and longitude) to provide accurate pickup and delivery timestamps, location-specific meta data, and geofencing capabilities to the VehicHaul SaaS software and applicable third party systems. If you have 'background location' services turned on, the VehicHaul mobile ePod Application will, from time to time, tell VehicHaul LLC SaaS software and applicable third party systems about your device's location even if you are not directly interacting with the application. This background tracking may be disabled by turning "background location" services off. While using the VehichHaul mobile ePod Application, location data is required to be collected. VehicHaul LLC uses various technologies to determine location, including IP Address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide VehicHaul LLC with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers.
