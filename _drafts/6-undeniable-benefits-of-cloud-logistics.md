6 Undeniable Benefits of Cloud Based Logistics Management

“The cloud” has been a tech industry buzzword for years now, but despite the hype, cloud computing really has introduced revolutionary changes across a wide range of industries -- including the logistics industry. Cloud based solutions offer real-time data acquisition and updating, integrated communication, and sophisticated analytics, helping logistics companies improve their operational efficiency while minimizing overhead.

The impact of cloud computing on logistics has been immense. Today’s shipping and logistics operations are more efficient than ever before, thanks in part to cloud-based solutions that work in real time.

Here are some of the ways that cloud based logistics management is making warehousing and shipping processes more efficient, more cost-effective, and more quantifiable.

1) Cost effectiveness.

Cloud services are scalable, offering a range of features and pricing structures. For a company to maintain its own full-scale data storage network software, and integrate it with local systems, would be incredibly costly. Not only are there hardware and software costs, but this approach also requires highly paid IT professionals to maintain the systems.

Cloud services are essentially outsourced, and the cost of the cloud service company’s massive infrastructure is dispersed across all of their users. This means that a given company can access the resources they need at a reasonable price.

2) Real-time inventory.

Because information is stored remotely in the “cloud,” and transmitted via the Internet, inventory information can be updated instantly in real time. This helps companies respond faster to demand fluctuations, taking more precise control over inventory levels to meet demand for products while minimizing expenses.

3) Equipment and utilization patterns.

Cloud based logistics management allows companies to access and analyze detailed metrics, which they can use to gain insight into possible strategies for expediting shipping, making processes more efficient, and eliminating unnecessary expenses.

4) Integration

Cloud-based software platforms for supply chain management are designed to integrate seamlessly with other software and IT solutions that companies are already using.

5) Redundancy

Downtime or accidental data loss could be catastrophic for a logistics company. Cloud solutions provide a necessary redundancy to avoid such a costly and damaging incident. An isolated localized solution could easily be compromised by an outage. If even one server area malfunctions, it could have a ripple effect that cascades through the entire system.

Cloud systems keep data and software around multiple servers for fast access and data protection. Information stored in a cloud service is available from anywhere, not just from a single office or warehouse location, and backups are included in case of a server problem. The cost of working with a cloud service is generally far lower than the cost of maintaining these kinds of systems internally.

6) Resource Flexibility

Data stored in a cloud service can be made available to your entire team, regardless of their location. This universal accessibility makes it easier to manage processes that require 24-hour oversight, and managers can view real-time information about shipping processes from any remote location.

Cloud Solutions: The Future of Logistics Management

Cloud-based solutions for logistic management provide a cost-effective, scalable, and secure option for storing and accessing data and information. With real time updating, access to useful metrics, and a scalable setup that can expand easily as your business grows, it’s no wonder that logistics companies are increasingly making the move to the cloud.
