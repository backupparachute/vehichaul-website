How EPOD Makes Vehicle Delivery a Whole Lot Easier

It’s the 21st century, and it’s becoming clear that old-fashioned paper documents can’t keep up. Electronic proof of delivery (EPOD) systems have been shown to cut costs, speed up delivery schedules, and lower the overall costs for shipping companies of all kinds. Vehicle delivery is no exception, and this robust, flexible technology solution may soon become an industry standard.

EPOD has also made vehicle delivery drivers’ jobs a lot easier. Running on handheld mobile devices, this software can update order details instantly, arrange for invoices to be printed, and even manage returns. Eliminating paperwork isn’t just good for the environment -- it also removes time-consuming hassles for drivers and reduces the risk of errors or uncertainty. This makes a driver’s job easier, leaving them free to focus on delivering vehicles in a timely manner.

Vehicle Deliveries Run More Smoothly

Manual processes like paper-based proof of delivery are still used by many vehicle delivery companies, but using paper is a well-known source of problems that can have a negative impact on both driver efficiency and customers’ experiences. If there are ongoing problems during the delivery process, paper documents make it impossible to adjust data in real time. Human error, lost pieces of paper, and other risks can throw off productivity in the entire supply chain.

EPOD systems can run on drivers’ personal smartphones, or on separate company-issued tablets. These mobile devices also function as a GPS, a barcode scanner, and a telephone, cutting costs by consolidating multiple functions into one multipurpose device.

EPOD also provides real-time updates on a transport vehicle’s location and status, vastly improving traceability during the vehicle delivery process. Some of the problems that EPOD addresses include:

Human error. Human error is always a concern for logistics and shipping. One accidental omission or incorrect piece of information on a paper form could cause serious problems down the line. EPOD systems running through mobile smart devices capture proof and documentation of each step of the delivery process, often automatically. EPOD has proven itself less error-prone than paperwork, allowing drivers to focus on their job instead of worrying about manual documentation.

Inefficiency. Vehicle delivery drivers can spend an inordinate amount of time filling out paperwork. Each moment that they’re filing papers, they’re not moving more vehicles from point A to point B. Paper just isn’t very efficient. Because EPOD speeds up and automates this documentation process, drivers can get more done in the course of a typical workday. For the companies delivering the vehicles, less wasted time means greater overall driver productivity, and thus, more revenue.

Cash flow. Mobile EPOD systems can accept signatures and capture documents, making it possible for drivers to electronically file digital “paperwork” on the road. With documents and process invoices submitted almost immediately, billing cycles are sped up, improving cash flow for the company as a whole.

Operational costs. Processing paperwork can get surprisingly expensive. Not only does EPOD speed up document submission, improving the efficiency of drivers who might otherwise be stuck doing paperwork, but it also reduces overhead associated with the paper itself. Eliminating the labor costs of paper processing can lead to monthly savings of almost $4000 for a fleet of 20 trucks.

For vehicle delivery drivers, EPOD removes the annoying hassle of physical paperwork. This lets drivers get more actual deliveries done, which ultimately improves the company’s cash flow. EPOD frees drivers from the hassle of worrying about making a mistake while filling out important documents, and allows them to alter and update information instantaneously from anywhere. These simple smartphone- and tablet-based systems are quickly overtaking traditional manual paper documentation, a development that’s helping to make the vehicle delivery process more efficient than ever before.
