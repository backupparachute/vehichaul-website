## How the Internet of Things will Impact Logistics

The Internet is so ubiquitous today that it’s hard to imagine life without it. It’s been through several iterations, from old-school BBS systems to today’s increasingly mobile-centric landscape. But the next big step forward in Internet technology is just over the horizon, and has been in the making for quite some time. It’s called the Internet of Things, and it involves extending internet connectivity to physical objects that are not things you’d normally think of as computerized.   Much of the press surrounding IoT technology has focuses on its applications for consumer goods, like smart home integration and refrigerators that sense when you’re out of milk. But Wifi-capable toasters are far from being the only application for this technology. It also has promising applications for commerce and industry, including the potential to revolutionize logistics management.

### IoT for Logistics: Tracking & Transparency

Using Internet of Things technologies, the status of assets, people, and parcels can be monitored by shipping companies in real time throughout the entire supply chain. This creates the potential for further automation, which can eliminate the need for manual interventions while reducing costs and improving accuracy.

The Internet of Things for logistics can be divided into a twofold structure: “sensing and sensemaking,” as it’s been described by Dalsey, Hillbom, & Lynn. “Sensing” refers to enhanced monitoring, like real-time tracking of parcels. “Sensemaking” refers to analytics, the ability to take data generated by IoT sensors and analyze it to gain insights to help optimize operational efficiency and reduce overhead costs.

The recent growth of mobile internet, “big data,” and other IT solutions are leading logistics companies to adopt IoT technologies at an increasing rate. It’s safe to say that the Internet of Things can be described as “the future of logistics management.”

### Managing Fleets Operational Efficiency

One of the many applications of IoT for logistics is optimizing the utilization of assets, notably vehicles. Connected vehicles are projected to create new efficiency gains. In an example from public transportation, the Seoul City Transportation Information Center in South Korea uses IoT technologies to manage and gather information about all public transportation vehicles in the area. Using GPS, road sensors, video cameras, and even citizen reports, they’ve leveraged an unprecedented amount of data to find ways to improve operational efficiency. They’ve successfully reduced traffic, improved transport services, and increased customer satisfaction.

Similar initiatives could easily be applied to shipping fleets. IoT technologies allow real time acquisition of vast amounts of data, which can be used to find new ways to optimize usage of individual vehicles, speed up delivery schedules, and reduce overall costs.

### Connecting the Production Floor

IoT can also be leveraged in warehouse and factory environments, where information about machine performance, energy usage, inventory status, and the movement of parcels can be tracked and documented in real time.

### Monitoring Equipment and Employee Safety

IoT can also be used to monitor both people and equipment, enhancing worker safety and enabling preventive maintenance. Networks of sensors gathering and reporting real-time data can indicate when a piece of machinery or equipment is near failure, enabling companies to fix it before failure actually occurs.

### The Future is Here

The Internet of Things isn’t a far-off sci-fi concept. In fact, the integration of IoT technologies into logistics operations is already underway. This increased connectivity provides valuable data and monitoring that can help logistics companies operate more efficiently, eliminate wasteful spending, and optimize usage of fleet vehicles.
