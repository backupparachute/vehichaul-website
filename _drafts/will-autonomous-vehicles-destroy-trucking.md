## Will Autonomous Vehicles Destroy the Trucking Industry?

Self-driving cars have long been a dream of science fiction writers and futurists, but today, this seemingly far-future technology is getting closer every day. Companies like Google and Tesla are already pioneering autonomous vehicle technology, pumping ample funding into it and recruiting some of the world’s most brilliant engineers. We could very well be moving toward a world where cars literally drive themselves.

This sounds great for consumers. After all, driving is a dangerous activity. In 2012, an average of 92 people died each day in fatal car accidents. Most people aren’t very good drivers, especially those who don’t drive professionally.

But what do autonomous vehicles mean for America’s 3.5 million professional truck drivers? Autonomous trucks are already being developed; in Australia, mining company Rio Tinto uses remote controlled driverless trucks in its Pilbara iron mines.

Are truckers working on borrowed time? Will self-driving autonomous commercial vehicles completely replace human drivers? If so, will millions of truck drivers suddenly find themselves unemployed, with their jobs stolen by robots?

### Driverless Trucks Aren’t Ready Just Yet

Other than the Pilbara mines example, autonomous trucks are something that’s still in development. It will take a lot of research, testing, and public trust to allow unmanned vehicles onto America’s roads.

If you’re thinking about becoming a truck driver, this is a good time. There’s actually a truck driver shortage, and with driverless trucks still years away, the world needs more professional commercial drivers.

Interestingly, although true Robo-Trucks aren’t making their debut on America’s roads anytime soon, there are other autonomous vehicle technologies that will actually help human truckers do their jobs, instead of replacing them completely.

### Advanced Driver Assistance Systems: Making Truckers’ Jobs Safer & Easier

Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) is a term referring to a variety of technologies that aid human drivers. Some of the things that fit this description are so common nowadays, that people take them for granted -- things like power steering, cruise control, and automatic gear switching. These things are stepping stones toward higher degrees of vehicle autonomy, but despite progress in that direction, the world isn’t ready for a driverless semi truck just yet.

Traction control and anti-lock braking systems are also ADAS technologies that help truckers drive more safely. There have also been recent advancements in electronic stability control (ESC). These computerized systems assess road conditions and adjust vehicle handling automatically, improving the truck’s stability to decrease the risk of rollover accidents.

All of these tools come together to create a system that can’t function without a human being in the driver’s seat, but that uses automated and computerized processes to make driving safer. With ADAS technologies like ESC and sophisticated blind spot camera and sensor systems, trucks can automatically detect an obstacle in their path, alert the driver, and brake the vehicle autonomously. These capabilities reduce the truck’s kinetic energy in the face of an oncoming collision, turning what would have been a devastating accident into a near miss.

### Today’s Autonomous Technologies Help Truckers Instead of Replacing Them

Truly autonomous driverless trucks are a ways off, despite what some futurists might tell you. Today, recent advancements in computerized and autonomous systems for commercial trucks aren’t designed to replace the human driver at all. Instead, they provide safety mechanisms and failsafes that keep drivers, and the other cars on the road, safer from accidents.

Someday, trucks might drive themselves. But today, there’s more of a need than ever for experienced commercial truck drivers to move important shipments from point A to point B. If you’re a trucker, a robot isn’t going to take your job any time soon.
