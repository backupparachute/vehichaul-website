To be a leader in the vehicle hauling industry, it is important to incorporate solutions that increase productivity, enable accurate tracking and simplify the processes and procedures that can cost you money in the long run. The idea of electronic proof of delivery is not just an idea anymore – it is a reality – and a necessity for wholesale deliveries. 

You don’t have to jump on the bandwagon if you don’t want to, but your business may suffer if your technology is not in place to record damages, upload photos, track deliveries and communicate with vendors and clients. In fact, you may find that adopting cloud technology may even improve your drivers’ abilities to record problems, improve response times and effectively handle complaints regarding damaged goods. 

The Benefits of ePOD:

- An ePOD mobile app, such as VehicHaul, eliminates the need for paper invoices, delivery comments and damage reports that are too easily lost or inaccurate. Your drivers can take pictures of damaged vehicles, allow clients to sign for deliveries and input customer notes all from their mobile device. 
- ePOD mobile apps can be integrated with existing software. For example, a driver who inputs data into the VehicHaul mobile app can instantly send information to the home office. Real-time data is valuable in a fast-paced business and frees up the time and energy of employees, drivers and executives. 
- Your customers not only prefer innovative procedures that save time and money, but they expect them. You may be apprehensive about adopting new software or digitizing your records, but the simplicity of adopting the VehicHaul app combined with the need to maintain relationships and succeed as a vehicle carrier is well worth it.
