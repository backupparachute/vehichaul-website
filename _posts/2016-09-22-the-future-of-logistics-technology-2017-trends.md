Rapid technology advancements are changing the logistic and transportation industry. If not too long ago, the Internet of Things (IoT), automation, and drone delivery were things of pure science fiction, nowadays, transportation companies are integrating them to provide faster, cheaper, and more reliable delivery.

Welcome to the hyper-connected world of logistic industry. Here’s a look at the five major trends that will shape the future of logistic technology in 2017.

### 1. Increasing Use of the Internet of Things

This revolutionary technology was mainly used to enable machine-to-machine communication and improve shipping efficiency. But, IoT is expected to play a bigger role in the future of logistics in 2017 and increase speed, reduce waste and decrease overall costs. Many believe that IoT will enable communication with other new technologies, such as AIDC (Automatic Identification and Data Capture,) RFID (Radio Frequency Identification,) or Bluetooth to identify elements that need to change according to demands of companies and customers.

### 2. The Growth of Bluetooth Technology

While the Internet of Things plays a crucial role in changing the face of logistic technology, many key players are starting to understand that non-data-driven communication and devices could hold a valuable promise for increasing quality control and accountability. As a result, you can expect to see plenty of Bluetooth-enable devices mounted on docks, loaders, and through the entire shipping process to send information about the packages. This technology will improve shipment tracking and logistic accuracy.

### 3. The Use of Robots Will Make the Logistic Industry More Efficient

The use of robots in loading, unloading, and even delivery will increase in 2017. In fact, Amazon is already using an army of robots to carry shelves of products to human workers and plans to automate its worldwide warehouses in the following years. Automation will help logistic companies to ship items to customers faster, cheaper, and with great accuracy.

### 4. Autonomous Vehicles Will Change Logistic Technology

Volvo Trucks made headlines when they recently announced that they would start testing the self-driving version of their FMX truck inside the Boliden mine in Sweden over the next year. Of course, Volvo isn’t sending their trucks in an underground mine just for fun. They will be using the data to develop driverless trucks that can be used by logistic companies to improve and streamline their services.

### 5. Electronic Logging Devices

Incorporating innovative technology to build a successful business is just as important in the logistic industry as it is in any other niche. Electronic logging devices (ELD) are one of the best ways to keep a competitive edge and, with the impending [FMCSA Ruling](https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/hours-service/elds/electronic-logging-devices), it is very likely to become a sought after technology in 2017. More and more companies will attach an ELD to their vehicles to accurately record driving hours.

Moreover, an mobile solution, such as VehicHaul can help you streamline shipments by collecting proof of delivery information and allowing you to communicate better with both drivers and clients.

The logistics industry is going through a time of unprecedented transformation. New technologies are frequently emerging, promising to change how shipping companies function.

VehicleHaul is currently doing R&D with J1939 adapters and determining the feasibility of an ELD pilot program. Are you ready to become part of the future?
